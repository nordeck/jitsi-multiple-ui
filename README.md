# Jitsi with multiple UI

This repo contains documents/files/config to support multiple UIs on a single
`Jitsi` setup.

## Custom UI

Create a custom user interface for each user group. This UI may be a simple
`HTML` page or a dynamic page generated by a server-side service such as
`nodejs`, `PHP`, etc.

No need to host these UI pages on the `Jitsi` server.

`Jitsi` will be embedded into custom user interfaces using
[Jitsi iFrame API](https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/dev-guide/dev-guide-iframe).

This is the first layer of customization and mostly cover customization of outer
space, not Jitsi itself.

For a sample page, check
[custom-ui-a.html](templates/custom-ui/custom-ui-a.html).
